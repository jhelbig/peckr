# peckr
Peckr was created as a tool for front-end development.  While developing my own projects, I noticed the need to grab colors from places off the web that inspired me, but Peckr needed to be more than just a color reader.  I needed a way to directly copy a color code for immediate use.  The first version of Peckr was extremely basic, but suited my needs well.  Over time I decided to also add rgb color copy as well.  It currently is part of my daily development toolkit.  Peckr is fully contained within one executable, that can be run from a flash-drive.  It has a small footprint so it can be run on almost any system with ease.  Currently it has only been tested to work with Windows 7.  Unfortunately Peckr will only be available for Windows.
